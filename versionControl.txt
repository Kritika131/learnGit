What is version control?
--------------------------------------------
  Version control - also known as source control or revision control - is an important software development practice for tracking and managing changes made to code and other files. 
  It is closely related to source code management.

What is a version control system?
   A version control system (VCS) tracks changes to a file or set of files over time. 
   The most common type is a centralized VCS, which uses a server to store all the versions of a file.
   Developers can check out a file from the server, make changes, and check the file back in. 
   The server then stores the new version of the file.
